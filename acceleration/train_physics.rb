#
# This is a very simple physics simulator for trains.
#
# We model only straight-line continuous acceleration, with no
# consideration of drag or friction losses, nor curvature.  We
# do not consider braking -- depending on whether you're doing
# regenerative or dynamic or friction the parameters may be
# substantially similar or quite different.
#
# Trains are modeled as having a fixed power output P and mass m, with
# a maximum acceleration a_max (this can be deduced from the tractive
# effort by dividing by the mass of an unloaded train).  For
# convenience, all units are metric; output acceleration is in m/s^2,
# speed in m/s, and distance in m.  Power and mass are related; either
# kilowatts and tonnes or watts and kilograms can be used, but we use
# the former because the latter implies greater precision than we
# actually have.
#
# The model assumes that the train will accelerate at a constant rate
# from start until it reaches its peak output power, at which point
# the acceleration is P/mv as a consequence of the law of conservation
# of energy.  The actual acceleration curve is more complex: a diesel
# locomotive may have a very high starting tractive effort, but the
# continuous effort is typically much lower (and at a much lower rated
# speed).
#
# Conversion factors:
#   m to ft: divide by 0.3048
#   m to mi: divide by 1609.3
#   m/s to mi/h: multiply by 2.2369
#   m/s/s to ft/s/s: divide by 0.3048
#   lbf to N: multiply by 4.4482
#   lbm to kg: 0.4359
#   short ton to t: multiply by 0.9072
#   hp to kW: multiply by 0.7457
#
